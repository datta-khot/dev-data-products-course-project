This repository contains Shiny application to show different model information using default ChickWeight dataset. It builds the model using user selected regression algorithms - lm or glm.
```{r}
#summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
